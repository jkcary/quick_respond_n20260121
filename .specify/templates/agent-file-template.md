## Constitution

This project follows principles defined in [.specify/memory/constitution.md](.specify/memory/constitution.md).

**English AI Agent (EAA) Core Principles**:
1. **Component-First**: Build reusable, platform-agnostic React components
2. **API-First**: Unified gateway for all LLM services with error handling
3. **User-First**: Prioritize student learning experience and accessibility
4. **Cross-Platform**: Seamless operation on Electron (Windows) and Capacitor (Android)
5. **Offline-First**: Local storage, graceful degradation, queue-and-sync
6. **Data Stability**: Schema versioning, backward-compatible migrations
7. **Performance**: Bundle < 50MB, startup < 3s, queries < 100ms

**Quality Standards**:
- Educational: Immediate feedback, positive reinforcement, spaced repetition
- Privacy: Local-first storage, encrypted API keys, no PII collection
- Accessibility: Screen reader, keyboard navigation, high contrast support

All development must align with these principles unless explicitly justified.
